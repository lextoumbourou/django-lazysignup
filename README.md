Introduction
============

Note: this fork has been customised to allow it to operate with ``django-email-as-username``

``django-lazysignup`` is a package designed to allow users to interact with a
site as if they were authenticated users, but without signing up. At any time,
they can convert their temporary user account to a real user account.
